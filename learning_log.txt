Medical Physics Learning Log

Date:
Today I created my first GitHub repository.

Future goals:
- Learn Python
- Work on DICOM analysis
- Build ML model for gamma prediction

Progress update:
I learned how to upload and edit files on GitHub.
Next step: learn version history.
Now I am using Git from my computer.
This feels professional.
